# Pico de gallo

Works really nicely with tacos. Could fit into sweet marinades and sauces
together with BBQ.

## Ingredients

* 4 Tomatoes
* 1 Red onion
* 2 Garlic cloves
* 1 Lime
* Jalape√±o or other peppers to taste. You could use the pickled ones in a jar.
* Coriander (optional)

## Instructions

1. Chop the tomatoes, onion and peppers into the size you want and add to a
   bowl.

2. Finely chop the garlic and then add a little bit of salt and squash into a
   paste. Add to the bowl.

3. If you're adding coriander, chop it to similar size as the rest of the
   ingredients and then add to the rest.

4. Squeeze the lime over the bowl and season to taste. Mix before serving.
